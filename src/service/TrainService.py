        In this method, we perform sentiment analysis on the reviews with these steps:
        1) We have a list of review texts without any sentiment labels.
        2) We tokenize the reviews by splitting them into words.
        3) We train a Word2Vec model on the tokenized reviews to learn word embeddings.
        4) We generate review embeddings by averaging the word embeddings for each review.
        5) We perform clustering using the KMeans algorithm on the review embeddings. Here, we specify the number of clusters as 2, assuming we want to group the reviews into two sentiment clusters (positive and negative).
        6) We evaluate the clustering performance using the silhouette score, which measures how well the reviews are clustered.
        7) We print the reviews along with their assigned cluster labels.
        8) We predict the cluster for a new review by tokenizing it, generating its embedding, and using the trained KMeans model.

        In this unsupervised approach, we don't have explicit sentiment labels. Instead, we rely on the clustering algorithm to group similar reviews together based on their embeddings. The assumption is that reviews with similar sentiments will have similar embeddings and will be clustered together.
        Note that the interpretation of the clusters as positive or negative sentiment may require manual inspection of the reviews within each cluster. Additionally, the optimal number of clusters may vary depending on the data and the desired granularity of sentiment analysis.
