"""Here's a step-by-step approach to solving the task using Python:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
   - Load the data files into Python using libraries like pandas.
   - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing:
     - Handle missing values
     - Convert data types if necessary
     - Merge relevant datasets based on common columns
   - Explore the data to gain initial insights
"""
import pandas as pd

# Load data files
listings_df = pd.read_csv('./../data/raw/listings.csv')
calendar_df = pd.read_csv('calendar.csv')
reviews_df = pd.read_csv('real_state_price_prediction/data/raw/reviews.csv')
listings_summary_df = pd.read_csv('listings_summary.csv')
reviews_summary_df = pd.read_csv('reviews_summary.csv')
neighbourhoods_df = pd.read_csv('real_state_price_prediction/data/raw/neighbourhoods.csv')

# Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
# ...

# Merge relevant datasets
# ...

"""
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Analyze the general situation of the temporary rental market on Airbnb in Madrid.
   - Use visualizations to gain insights:
     - Plot the distribution of properties across different neighbourhoods using geospatial data
     - Analyze the distribution of rental prices
     - Explore the relationship between property features and rental prices
   - Utilize natural language processing techniques to analyze review data and extract meaningful insights
"""

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Visualize the distribution of properties across neighbourhoods
# ...

# Analyze the distribution of rental prices
# ...

# Explore the relationship between property features and rental prices
# ...

# Analyze review data using natural language processing
# ...

"""
3. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features based on the available data to improve the predictive model
   - Examples:
     - Calculate the distance of each property from popular landmarks or city center
     - Extract sentiment scores from review text data
     - Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding
"""

# Create new features
# ...

# Encode categorical variables
# ...

"""
4. Predictive Modeling:
   - Split the data into training and testing sets
   - Train and evaluate different predictive models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests)
   - Use appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared) to assess model performance
   - Perform model selection and hyperparameter tuning to find the best model
   - Interpret the model results and identify important features
"""

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Split the data into training and testing sets
# ...

# Train and evaluate different models
# ...

# Perform model selection and hyperparameter tuning
# ...

# Interpret the model results
# ...

"""
5. Reporting and Interpretation:
   - Summarize the findings from the exploratory data analysis
   - Interpret the results of the predictive modeling
   - Provide business recommendations based on the insights gained
   - Create visualizations and reports to effectively communicate the results

6. Deployment and Production:
   - Propose a deployment strategy for the solution
   - Consider factors such as scalability, performance, and maintainability
   - Suggest technologies and frameworks for deploying the model (e.g., Flask, Docker, cloud platforms)
   - Discuss the necessary steps for monitoring and updating the model in production

Remember to document all the design decisions made throughout the process, including the choice of algorithms, feature engineering techniques, and evaluation metrics.
