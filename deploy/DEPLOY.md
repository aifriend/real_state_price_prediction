# Model Deployment

By following this deployment solution, the predictive model can be made available to the client 
as a scalable and maintainable API service. The client can then integrate the API into their own systems 
or applications to obtain predicted prices for their properties in different neighborhoods of Madrid.
   
Prioritize security, performance, and reliability throughout the deployment process 
and ensure that the client's data and predictions are handled securely and efficiently.

# Deployment solution

## Prerequisites

* Flask
* WTForms
* Requests
* Dotenv
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* XGBoost
* Pickle

## Stages

1. Model Development
   - Develop and train the predictive model using the Inside Airbnb dataset for Madrid.
   - Perform necessary data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection.
   - Evaluate the model's performance and fine-tune it as needed.
   - Serialize the trained model using pickle or joblib for easy deployment.

2. API Development
   - Create a RESTful API using a web framework like Flask or FastAPI.
   - Define endpoints for receiving input data (property details) and returning predicted prices.
   - Load the serialized model into memory when the API server starts.
   - Implement request handling logic to preprocess input data and pass it to the model for prediction.
   - Return the predicted prices as a response to the API requests.

3. Containerization
   - Create a Dockerfile that specifies the runtime environment for the API server.
   - Include the necessary dependencies, such as Python and required libraries, in the Dockerfile.
   - Copy the API code and the serialized model into the Docker container.
   - Build the Docker image and test it locally to ensure it runs correctly.

4. Cloud Deployment
   - Choose a cloud platform for deployment, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
   - Set up a container orchestration service, like Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, to manage the deployment and scaling of the API server.
   - Configure the necessary resources, such as virtual machines or containers, to run the API server.
   - Deploy the Docker image to the chosen container orchestration service.
   - Set up load balancing and auto-scaling to handle incoming requests efficiently.

5. API Documentation and Client Integration
   - Create comprehensive API documentation that describes the available endpoints, request/response formats, and any authentication requirements.
   - Provide code examples or client libraries in popular programming languages to facilitate integration with the client's systems.
   - Collaborate with the client's development team to ensure smooth integration and address any compatibility issues.

6. Monitoring and Maintenance
   - Implement logging and monitoring solutions to track the API's performance, error rates, and resource utilization.
   - Set up alerts and notifications to promptly address any issues or anomalies.
   - Regularly update and patch the underlying infrastructure and dependencies to maintain security and performance.
   - Monitor the model's performance over time and retrain or update it as needed based on new data or changing requirements.

7. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
   - Establish a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) to manage the codebase and enable collaboration among team members.
   - Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and test the API server whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
   - Automate the deployment process to push the updated API server to the production environment after successful testing.
